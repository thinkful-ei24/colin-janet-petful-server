# Petful Server API

This API was developed to work with the colin-janet-petful app. <br>
A live link to the server can be found here: https://github.com/thinkful-ei24/colin-janet-petful-server

### Tech Stack

* Node.js
* express.js

## Databases

This app does not use a database.  Instead, it uses hard coded dummy-data which is stored in a Queue class.

### Using this app

* This app is not designed to be used by other developers.
* However! If other developers would like to use this app, a queue class is included, <br>
and there is unused functionality to hook up to a database found at the bottom of index.js <br>
and in the in the files prefixed with "db-".
